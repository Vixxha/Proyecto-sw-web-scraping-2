/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for ComponentCompares
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles
 * and allows public read access to products.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, with the document ID matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information accessible to all users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled.
 * - Product data is publicly readable but only writeable with appropriate authentication (TODO).
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for user profiles, ensuring only the authenticated user can
 *   read and modify their own profile data.
