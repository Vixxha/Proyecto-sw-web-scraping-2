/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and their associated sales data,
 *              while allowing public read access to product information and restricting access to audit logs.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles.  Only the authenticated user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/sales/{saleId}: Stores sales records associated with a specific user. Only the authenticated user can read/write their own sales records.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information. Public read access is allowed.
 * - /sales/{saleId}: A global collection of all sales data. Intended for superuser querying; access is restricted to authenticated users only.
 * - /audit_logs/{auditLogId}: Stores audit logs. Access is restricted to authenticated users only.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Listing of all users is denied to prevent information disclosure.
 * - Product information is publicly readable, but write access is restricted.
 * - Sales and Audit Logs access is restricted to signed in users
