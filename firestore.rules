/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and allows public read access but owner-only write access to audit logs.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles. The {userId} must match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /audit_logs/{auditLogId}: Stores audit logs, accessible to any authenticated user for reading, but only writable with the correct ownership.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are only accessible and modifiable by the owning user. Listing of all users is disallowed.
 * - Audit logs are publicly readable but writable only with correct user id.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - For `users`: The `id` field within the user document must match the `userId` path parameter to ensure ownership.
 * - For `audit_logs`: The `userId` field is copied into the document to enforce ownership for create, update, and delete operations.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - There is no segregation of public vs. private user data. All user profile information is considered private and stored under the /users/{userId} path.
