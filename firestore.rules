/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ComponentCompares application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles,
 * preventing unauthorized access or modification. Audit logs are publicly readable
 * but only writable by trusted application code (not directly by users).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, with the document ID matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /audit_logs/{auditLogId}: Stores audit logs.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly denied to protect user privacy.
 * - Audit logs are designed for application-level logging and are not user-writable.
 * - All write operations require a verified and authenticated user.
