/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles
 * and restricts access to audit logs.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, where {userId} matches the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /audit_logs/{auditLogId}: Stores audit logs.  No specific access rules are defined beyond requiring authentication.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are only accessible and modifiable by the owning user.
 * - Listing users is not allowed.
 * - Audit logs can be created by anyone but are not readable.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `id` field in the User document is used to match the `userId` in the path,
 *   ensuring that users can only access their own profile.
