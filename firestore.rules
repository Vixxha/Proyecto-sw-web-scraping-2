/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and allows public read access but owner-only write access for audit logs.
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. The document ID is the same as the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /audit_logs/{auditLogId}: Stores audit logs for important actions within the system.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Listing of all users is disallowed.
 * - Audit logs are publicly readable but only the application can create them. The rules do not enforce which service account is creating them, that part is up to the backend.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization N/A - Simple ownership model.
 * @structuralSegregation N/A - No public vs private data.
