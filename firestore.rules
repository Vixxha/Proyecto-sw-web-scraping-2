/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ComponentCompares application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure data access based on user roles and ownership.
 * User data is strictly controlled, with superusers having elevated privileges.
 * The ruleset is designed to be adaptable during prototyping, focusing on authorization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles. The 'userId' MUST match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/sales/{saleId}: Sales records specific to a user.
 * - /products/{productId}: A global collection of product information, with write access restricted.
 * - /sales/{saleId}: A global collection of sales data, intended for querying by superusers.
 * - /audit_logs/{auditLogId}: Stores audit logs of system actions. Write-access should be carefully controlled.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Superuser Role: The 'superuser' role grants elevated access to read all sales records and audit logs. This role should be assigned carefully.
 * - User Ownership: Most data access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - Product Creation: Product creation and updates are currently open (TODO), but should be restricted to authorized users in a production setting.
 * - No User Listing: Listing all users is explicitly denied to prevent information exposure.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The rule doesn't contain denormalization logic, but it would be beneficial to add a `role` field to the `/users/{userId}` document to simplify superuser checks.
 *  - For Products, adding a `creatorId` field during creation allows easier control over modification/deletion.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - The separation of user-specific sales (/users/{userId}/sales/{saleId}) and global sales (/sales/{saleId}) enables both user-centric views and superuser-level reporting.
