/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and their associated sales data,
 *              while allowing public read access to product information and restricting write access to sales and audit logs.
 *              Superusers, identified via custom claims, have broader read access to sales data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles.  userId MUST match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/sales/{saleId}: Stores sales records specific to a user.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores publicly readable product information.
 * - /sales/{saleId}: Stores all sales data (accessible to superusers).
 * - /audit_logs/{auditLogId}: Stores audit logs (write-only).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Users can only manage (create, read, update, delete) their own sales records.
 * - Product information is publicly readable.
 * - Listing users is denied to all clients.
 * - Superusers can read all sales data.
 * - Regular users cannot list sales data.
 * - Audit logs can only be created (written by trusted server environment).
 * - Data validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase to facilitate rapid iteration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - To avoid costly `get()` operations, critical authorization data (e.g., user roles, ownership) should be
 *   denormalized directly onto documents. For example, a `Sale` document could include a `userId` field
 *   to simplify ownership checks.  This design currently exists.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private user data (profiles, sales) is stored under the `/users/{userId}` collection, while public product
 *   information is stored in the top-level `/products` collection. This separation simplifies access control.
