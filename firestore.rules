/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles
 * and allows public read access to product information.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, with the document ID matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information that is publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Products are publicly readable, but write operations are not secured in this prototype.
 *   A future iteration should secure product writes to authorized admins only.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The User document ID is enforced to match the Firebase Auth UID to simplify ownership checks.
