/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for ComponentCompares application.
 *
 * @corePhilosophy
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and allows public read access to product information.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, with the document ID matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information, accessible to all users for reading.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - User profiles are strictly controlled; only the authenticated user can read, update, or delete their own profile.
 * - Products are publicly readable, but write access is currently unrestricted. This should be updated to restrict write access based on roles or ownership in a production environment.
 * - User listing is disabled.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 * The user ID is enforced to be equal to the `userId` path parameter when creating a user document.
