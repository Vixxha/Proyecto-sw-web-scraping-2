/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ComponentCompares application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a strict, user-ownership model for personal data
 * while allowing controlled access to public product information. Superusers,
 * identified via custom claims, have broad read access for auditing and
 * reporting purposes.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles. Accessible only by the
 *   user themselves.
 * - /users/{userId}/sales/{saleId}: Stores sales records associated with a
 *   specific user. Accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information. Publicly readable but
 *   only writable by authorized users (not implemented in this prototyping phase).
 * - /sales/{saleId}: A top-level collection of sales data, accessible to superusers for auditing and reporting.
 * - /audit_logs/{auditLogId}: Stores audit logs. Write access is restricted (not fully implemented in this prototyping phase).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user data and associated sales records.
 * - Listing the `/users` collection is disallowed to prevent enumeration.
 * - Superusers (identified via custom claims) can read all sales data for
 *   reporting.
 * - The `products` collection is publicly readable, but write access is not
 *   defined in this prototype.
 * - The `audit_logs` collection is write-only by backend functions.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Sale` entity includes a `userId` field, denormalizing user
 *   ownership directly onto the sales document. This avoids the need for
 *   complex queries to determine ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Sales data is stored both under the user's profile and in a top-level
 *   collection. The user-specific sales are for the user, and the top-level sales collection are for superusers.
