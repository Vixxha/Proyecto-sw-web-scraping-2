/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for ComponentCompares
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles
 * and allows public read access to product information while restricting
 * modification access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, with the document ID
 *   matching the Firebase Auth UID. This enforces that users can only
 *   access their own profile data.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information. Read access is public,
 *   but modification is restricted.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Products are publicly readable to facilitate open access to product details.
