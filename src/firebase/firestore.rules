/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and sales data,
 * with public read access to products. Superusers have broader access to sales and audit logs.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /users/{userId}/sales/{saleId}: Stores sales records for each user, accessible only to the user.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information, publicly readable.
 * - /sales/{saleId}: Stores all sales data; accessible only to superusers.
 * - /audit_logs/{auditLogId}: Stores audit logs, accessible only to superusers.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile and sales data.
 * - Products are publicly readable, but write access is not defined (and thus denied).
 * - Listing of users is not allowed.
 * - Superusers require additional role checking logic, which is not implemented in this version.
 *   All superuser-only paths are currently locked down with `// TODO:` placeholders, pending the
 *   implementation of role-based access control.
 * - No data validation is performed beyond ownership checks.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Sale` entity includes a `userId` field to simplify ownership checks for sales records
 *   nested under `/users/{userId}` and in the top-level `/sales` collection.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Sales data is stored in both a user-specific subcollection and a global collection. This denormalization
 *   allows for both user-specific queries and superuser-level monitoring.
